This repository holds the source for gotype prior to it being removed
from the repository https://github.com/golang/tools .

The removal occurred in https://github.com/golang/tools/commit/f5a6ee1,
after code review at https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/37657/ .
That broke CI for tools like coala that need to install established
linters so that they can be regression tested against old versions of Go.

This repository can be used with "go get".

There is no plan to provide regular maintainance of this copy of gotype.
It should only be used with Go versions that were already released prior
to the gotype command being removed from the golang tools repository.
